# ðŸš€ Project Bootstrap for Multi-Agent Development

Welcome!  This repo is wired for:
1. **Branch-per-ticket** workflow (Planner â‡’ Coder branches â‡’ Merge-bot).
2. Automatic "repo â†’ markdown context" snapshots for AI agents.
3. Local or cloud CI with identical steps.

### One-time setup
```bash
brew install fswatch act            # <-- optional speed boosters
pip install -r requirements.txt     # only if you add deps later
```
